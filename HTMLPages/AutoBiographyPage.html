    From my school days I have been a good and sincere student in studies although I was somewhat naughty and talkative also at the same time.
    I have changed many school because of my father's many transfers. I thought of becoming a doctor when I was in middle classes but after that in 9<sup>th</sup>
    I changed my mind and got interested in Computer and day by day my interest grew bigger and bigger. The first programming language i started with then was Q-Basic and I did
    that by taking the help over internet. And after that i got a chance to learn some other language basics. Talking about games I am only interested badminton although I play
    it only for enjoyment and not for professional purpose. I also have many hobbies which I have discussed in Hobby section.
