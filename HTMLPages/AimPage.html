    My aim in life is to become a professional software developer and specilization in Application Development for Windows and Android, but still other programming tasks
    are also compatible for me. Speaking truly, I don't like backend development as much as frontend but still I have a small interest in backend development.
    Also, I have a strong interest in game development and i can also go for that instead of app development if needed.

    From everyone we can hear that we can become a great person if we do good practice also it should be needed that we should also have a good teacher.
    And throughout my life i have been getting good teacher in every subject and also met with a good teacher for computer science in 12<sup>th</sup> standard.
    Now also in college I have taken Software Development and the teachers here as well as the college is also good so that I can pursue my aim forward in my life and will get a successful job.
